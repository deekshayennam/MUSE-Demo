    "## What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multilingual document embedding model that converts text into a 512 dimension vector representation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Salient Features\n",
    "\n",
    "* Works with as many as 16 languages. Model is language-agnostic, meaning language of the text does not have to be specified to the model\n",
    "\n",
    "* Optimized for multi-word text like sentences and paragraphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "* The pre-trained model is available for use as a module on tensorflow-hub. \n",
    "* See the below code example for a simple demo\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "* The model size is pretty large. Inference can be time-consuming when running on a large dataset. Recommend using the input pipeline from tensorflow (tf.data) and leveraging batching when running the model on large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources\n",
